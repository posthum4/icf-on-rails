Increase brand awareness in the U.S. and position ECCO as a premium footwear brand through efficiently reaching the target via robust targeting strategies and strong contextual alignment.

Communication Objectives: 
•	Shift the brand perception of the ECCO and increase consideration
•	Drive purchase conversions via display banners
•	Result in strong video completions and clicks

The program should…
•	Be able to deliver in full 
•	Include costs that represent purely media
•	Include added value opportunities


Success Metrics
•	Click thru rate & completion rate
•	Conversions (purchase confirmation)


Viewability Requirement:
As part of this media buy, we will be requiring a Quality guarantee of 100%.  This means 100% of the media must be Viewable, Bot-Free, and served within appropriate content.  Viewability measurement will be based on IAS. You will have access to this reporting so you can audit performance and pacing.

We will be monitoring Quality on a placement level; if your numbers fall below the threshold, you will be required to deliver a makegood for that particular placement (impressions cannot be made up outside of the placement parameters, i.e. running ROS when a placement specifies content targeting).

Both Agency and Publisher teams should be looking at the Quality reports weekly to ensure proper pacing, with the goal of avoiding the need for a makegood.

Additional Requirements
•	U.S. Impressions only 
•	Include cross-screen opportunities across mobile and desktop
•	Unique targeting and methodology
o	Please include overview of algorithms and back-end optimization methods 
o	Reach the ECCO consumer via niche targeting (competitive conquesting, purchase based targeting, proprietary data partnerships, etc.)
•	Must accept DFA and Innovid ad tags
•	100% transparency
•	No objectionable sites on list (violent or inappropriate content)
•	Added value research opportunities (i.e. Vizu, Dynamic Logic, etc.)
•	Coverage of Innovid ad serving/IAS fees
•	All interactive/custom units must be created as added value

Please provide the following along with your Proposal
•	Scrubbed site list
•	Sample screenshots 
•	Proposal in attached Excel template
•	PowerPoint deck outline your proposal 
•	Site stats for the following:
o	Women 25-54 (Reach/ Comp %)
o	Women 35+ (Reach/ Comp %)
•	Any compelling audience research or historical past success that we can use as rationale for selling your program to our client


Evaluation

Our recommendation will be based on both cost-efficiency of individual elements and overall proposal. Components that will be weighted particularly heavily are efficient pricing models, exclusive access to inventory, unique targeting, adherence to viewability standards, and coverage of ad serving fees and brand study.

Please feel free to provide any compelling audience research or historical past success that can be used to justify your program.

Thanks in advance for your time and attention.","a1bn000000097NhAAI","0.0","Silver Analytics","false","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-28T01:42:44.000Z","","","12.0","0.0","","UM NY_Ecco 2015 Distribution Campaign_March -June 2015 - Campaign","12.0","0068000000uACwmAAG","","","00580000003ZuqZAAS","0.0","","","0.0","0.0","2015-04-28T01:42:44.000Z","","","vCPM Guarantee: 100% goal<br>comScore (preferred)","","","","","","""0018000000dpCjlAAE","00580000005GF49AAG","","","0018000000xHQsHAAW","","No Audience Hard Constraints","","Harvard Business School Executive Education","No Brand Safety","GroupM Blacklist","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","46999.99","2015-06-30","2014-07-14","","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-24T22:38:46.000Z","","USD","0068000000slZcHAAU","113892.37","Application Thanks Page: (Main KPI)

General Market and Hispanic Moms 18-34
•	Prenatal moms (please allocate 70% of budget)
•	Moms w/kids 0-2, grandparents & gift-givers willing to spend on higher ticketed items (please allocate 30% of budget)
OBJECTIVE
Establish Disney Baby as the brand of choice for moms, capturing them earlier in their family lifecycle thus increasing the lifetime value of the Disney Guest
•	Introduce the brand to a constantly churning mom target
•	Increase sales of Disney Baby licensed product
FY15 KEY INITIATIVES
Build awareness, engagement, and affinity with moms
Generate demand and drive sales of Disney Baby licensed products
Maximize registration and name capture
CREATIVE AVAILABLE
Standard IAB banners for desktop, mobile, tablet. Rich Media available.
Pre-Roll Video :15/:30
Assets can be provided for custom executions
THOUGHT STARTERS/ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
There will be an increased focus on product sales over branding moving into FY15. Branding will still play a role, but what types of unique executions can we do to help drive sales at specific retailers? For example, can you deliver pre-roll video to the target that ends with an engaging unit that drives to the nearest retailer to purchase the product featured in the video? What are some unique product feature executions you’ve done for other retail clients (ex: product carousels)?
How can you retarget consumers who have previously engaged with the brand, who we know are actual purchasers of Disney Baby/competitive brands, or who have recently purchased at a kids retailer? 
How can you help us reach prenatal/registry?
Please send any key internal research you have on marketing to moms. Particular points of interest are: Moms media habits, Hispanic moms, any research around how marketing should differ for marketing to prenatal vs current moms (i.e. are prenatal moms more receptive to brand advertising, etc.).

As you know, this year we approached our planning process a little differently.  We planned Q1 separately from Q2-Q4. We aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel with the overall strategy – we want to continue our top strategies from Q1 into Q2 and beyond (where applicable).

Desktop ACQ:

The KPI for Q2-Q4 will remain to cost-per-weighted-purchase (CPwP).  The goal cost per purch is $1,500 and is calculated at spend / 50% of new purchases. 

When you provide ACQ rates, please provide a media rate inclusive of Flashtalking ad serving fees.  We are working w/ FT to bring down the non working fees on each partner, but we still need you to provide the rates in the meantime.

Mobile ACQ:

Mobile KPI will remain consistent – the Q2-Q4 CPSL is $20.   

While the mobile budget is separate from the Desktop budget, please call out how you would connect the two plans through your technology.

Please return the RFPs by Friday, January 30th.   

Thanks!
Susan.","a1bn000000096mVAAQ","0.0","Platinum Analytics","false","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-28T01:42:43.000Z","","","8.0","0.0","","Starcom_USCC-Acq-Q'02-Q'04 2015 - Campaign","8.0","0068000000v19x6AAA","","","00580000003bA2VAAU","0.0","","","0.0","0.0","2015-04-28T01:42:43.000Z","","Flashtalking paid by Rocket Fuel<br>","Reporting Only<br>comScore (preferred)","","","Rocket Fuel","","Flashtalking","""00180000012MMw1AAG","00580000005HPNsAAO","","NO ADD-ON PRODUCTS","0018000001I8TSpAAN","","No Audience Hard Constraints","","Vinyl Siding Institute","No Brand Safety","","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","7500.0","2015-03-31","2015-03-04","","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-24T22:42:06.000Z","","USD","0068000000vbjiIAAQ","7500.0","Target Vinyl Siding Institute intenders","a1bn0000000968JAAQ","1.0","No Insights Package","false","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-28T01:42:43.000Z","","","6.0","0.0","","Vinyl Siding Institute (Reader's Digest).

I wanted to reach out and provide you with some information about an upcoming test on the Domino’s Campaign that will require a significant amount of preparation, coordination, and general attention on your side. Recent findings from the Domino’s client’s media mix model have called into question the effectiveness of display advertising. As a result, Domino’s would like to conduct a media density test across their National buy to evaluate the impact display ads have on sales. 

The test will be conducted via the following methodology. Starting on 7/28, you will need to break up the current campaign into three different geo-targeted groups according to the state lists (attached for reference). You will receive new tags for each state group. Per the normal IO process, budget levels will be communicated for each group of states. Verification of the state targeting will be based on OAS, just as the frequency capping and active/inactive blocking is conducted on the current National Campaign. In other words, impressions served outside of the desired states will not be paid out on; a PSA ad will be served for these impressions. As such, it is crucial that you agree to running the campaign this way and are prepared to give it daily attention to ensure that the geo-targeting in your system is correctly aligned with that of OAS.

The campaign will run this way for three weeks. After the first three weeks, the media density levels will shift, and you will need to adjust the targeting accordingly for the final three weeks. For example, if you were targeting Group #3 at 100% budget level for the first three weeks, you would then shift this to 50% for the last three weeks.  This can be seen in the slide attached. The test will be 6 weeks total. IOs will be sent out to reflect this.

Again, the state-targeting will need to be done in your system according to what is shown on your IO. As such, the only scenario in which you would end up paying for a PSA ad is when an impression is served outside of the desired states. Reporting on this will be provided on a regular basis.

The test will take place in two waves:
-	Wave 1: 7/21/2014-8/17/2014
-	Wave 2: 8/18/2014-9/14/2014

The parameters of the test are as follows: the country will be broken out into three different groups of states. These groups of states will then be tested at:
-	0% media spend: no media will be served in these states
-	50% media spend: we will reduce your normal budget by 50% for these states
-	100% media spend (control): maintain current spend on display
Priority during this test will shift from CPO to pacing and delivery. We will need to keep a close eye on performance, but the most important factor for making this a clean test is that we pace appropriately and deliver the specified budgets. We understand that CPO cannot be held to the same standards during this test.","a1bn000000094L4AAI","8.0","No","false","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-28T01:42:40.000Z","","","12.0","0.0","","Mindshare_Domino's Q3 Density Test - Campaign","14.0","0068000000rBFeiAAG","","","00580000005FTrmAAG","0.0","","- Select Add-On Products<br>","0.0","0.0","2015-04-28T01:42:41.000Z","Ad Blocking","","No Viewability Requested","Rocket Fuel","","","","","""0018000000mDhIlAAK","00580000005EJT0AAO","","NO ADD-ON PRODUCTS","0018000000oItcOAAS","","No Audience Hard Constraints","","Asics FY15 Digital Media Plan","No Brand Safety","","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","","NO BRAND SAFETY PRODUCT","300000.0","2015-11-30","2015-02-01","","00580000005HzViAAK","2015-04-24T22:27:15.000Z","","USD","0068000000v3lSgAAI","300000.0","OBJECTIVE
